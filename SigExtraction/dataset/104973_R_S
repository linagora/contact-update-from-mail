#reply#>This Braves team is made up of slow starters.  People are amazed that the
#reply#>Braves aren't hitting.  Don't be.  They weren't hitting last year at this
#reply#>time, nor were they the year before.  They had slow Aprils and Mays in the
#reply#>1991 and 1992 seasons,  and yet they still managed to go to the Series in
#reply#>those years.  Well, this team is no different, so why should we be suprised
#reply#>at their slow start?  They started that way for the past two years, and
#reply#>they'll be that way until the Richmond club makes it to the majors.  Judge
#reply#>their offense in June or July when things start to average out.  I'm just
#reply#>happy that the Reds have gotten off to such a poor start.  The Giants always
#reply#>do well in the early part of the season, but they'll be out of the race by
#reply#>July (just like the last few years).  Unless Bond's developes a knuckelball,
#reply#>their staff will get rocked by mid-June.  

Wow! You really know how to hurt a guy. Guess I shouldn't bother watching
any more games. It's already been decided. :^)
