#reply#>	Steel may not melt at 1000C, but it will weaken, expand and deform.
#reply#>	If there is enough of a load on the steel, like the load on a steel
#reply#>	roof truss, or the pressure exerted by steel parts in a machine
#reply#>	trying to expand against each other, the steel can and will
#reply#>	deform extensively. For the record, any weapon found in
#reply#>	the cult compound should be indentifiable, but it may be
#reply#>	impossible to do normal ballistics tests because of the 
#reply#>	damage done to the weapon.
 	
If, if, if....  Anyway, the question was if the gun was identifiable, which
it is.
