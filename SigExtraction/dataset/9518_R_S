#reply#>Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the
#reply#>opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually
#reply#>incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and
#reply#>optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer
#reply#>you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick
#reply#>up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.
#reply#>That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version. You
#reply#>could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself
#reply#>I sprang for Word.

The value of these workshops aside, you ought to be able to buy full copies
of all this software through your campus bookstore or software distributor
at these rates.  I'm not aware that the educational version of Word or Excel
is doped down in any way.

#reply#>Well, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone
#reply#>will go to a workshop and save a little money.
#reply#>
#reply#>And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.
#reply#>I need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)

#reply#>Thanks,
