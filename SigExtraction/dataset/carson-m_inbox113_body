Hey what's up?!
When is it? He told me about it, but I can't remember when it is.

Are you going?

How's everything going?  Wife, kid--good?  Not much here...I'm have started selling photos to a few magazines and to some realtors.  I am getting some prints made to try and get into some galleries around here(and to sell on the side).  No girlfriend, not going out very much at all, doing alot of mtn. bike races, climbing alot of mtns., taking alot of photos, and enjoying life in the mtns.--that's pretty much what's been happening in my life.

Talk to you later,
Cody

ps, use codydownard@hotmail.com
since I don't work in HR anymore, it's kinda hard for me to check this email address regularly.
