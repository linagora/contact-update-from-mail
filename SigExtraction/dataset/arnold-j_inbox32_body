I completely understand and thanks for letting me know.  Maybe when I become a famous rock star and leave Enron you will reconsider.  I don't know if I can make it on Friday.  I am singing in a good friends wedding this weekend and the rehearsal dinner is Friday night.  If you are going to be out any other time this week let me know and if not I can get it next week.  How was your weekend with your friend?  
 
Talk to you soon.
