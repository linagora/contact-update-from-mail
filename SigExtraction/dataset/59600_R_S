Precisely.  One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
could be causing "difficulty with his behavior".  Standard practice would
be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.  One would want to
rule out the possibility that the "bad behavior" is not psychiatric
illness at all.
