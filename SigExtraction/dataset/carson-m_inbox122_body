hey all,

i got a message from hess's wife, michelle, and she
indicated that he was doing well after surgery.  the
doctors removed 95% and he was conscious in icu
afterwords.   that's all i know, but i'll keep you
updated.  take care and have a merry christmas.  feel
free to pass the news on to anyone that you see fit.

see ya...besch
