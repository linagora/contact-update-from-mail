I would like to set up a brief meeting in the afternoon this week or next, to discuss increasing the liquidity in west basis on EOL.  It would be helpful for our desk to sit down with John Arnold and John Lavorato to openly discuss the importance of continuing to increase liquidity on EOL.
 
I would also like to put to rest the notion that increasing liquidity leads to negative P&L and that a Trader's support of EOL liquidity will go unrecognized at year end PRC.
 
Please email me with a response of when we could set up such a meeting.
