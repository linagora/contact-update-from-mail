Sheri
The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls & meetings. Also cc me on their emails or forward to me  their  emails. This will keep me in the loop. Thanks

Phillip
If you have some additional people in mind, we need them identified as soon as possible. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk

Kirk -

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from Enron Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the
storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and
enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Have a good day!

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve
