I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded
with the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on
its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.

So, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time
SEEING the grayscale image you want to print.
