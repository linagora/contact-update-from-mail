Hi,

If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
SDK of some sort that contains the HC.EXE or HC31.EXE file to 
compile and generate .HLP files out of .RTF files.
RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W.

If this is not the solution be more specific about your application.

Mario
