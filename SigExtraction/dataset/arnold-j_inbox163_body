Tracy called me at work.  A water pipe broke under the street between her house and the old Hamilton house.  She said water was shooting everywhere and that they were to turn off the water for at least 5 hours.  Well, they worked fast because when I got home at 6:00, I had water.  So I made some turkey soup.  But Willow Lane will be torn up for a while as it just buckled the cement.  The hole was about 7 feet down according to Tracy.  Good thing this didn't happen on Thanksgiving!  I have a foundation man coming out next week to check the foundation.  Tracy seems to have a similar problem.  Maybe we can get a two for one deal.    John, I need your book list at Amazon.com this week.  No excuses!  Oh, tell Jeannie that I finished her soup this evening for dinner.  She's a good cook!  Have a good week guys.  Love, Mom
