Hi Eric,
 
It looks like Enron employees have an enterprising spirit according to the H. Chronicle.  Ebay is saturated with Enron goodies.  This is quite amusing.
 
Sorry about tonight and we will miss you on your birthday.  We will celebrate whenever you wish, just let us know.  If you change your mind about tomorrow, email me.  Donnita and Jason are coming over for dinner.  We would love for you to come.  
 
Have a wonderful day.  LU-M
