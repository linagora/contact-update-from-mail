#reply#	Doug> I  am  having  a  big problem trying to build MIT X11R5 with xlc 1.2.1
#reply#	Doug> (the  one  bundled  with  AIX  3.2.3e).   Its almost the linker is not
#reply#	Doug> working properly with shared libraries.
	
#reply# Doug> I've built X11R5 with no problem before .. but now its all  headaches.
#reply#	Doug> For example, the xset client complains that libXmu doesnt have a bunch
#reply#	Doug> of Xt routines and shr.o is missing (or  something  like  that).   The
#reply#	Doug> build of libXmu DOES link in libXt  so I am really perplexed  what  is
#reply#	Doug> going on.


#reply#	Doug> ....following up on this, the specific error I get is:
