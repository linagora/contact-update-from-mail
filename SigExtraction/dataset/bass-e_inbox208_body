Eric:

I trust everything is going well as Enron.  I am actively pursuing a job out
here at Mcdonalds.  "Would you like fries with that"...I practice on a
regular basis.

In any case, I would like to pick up the Patriots Defense and the Steelers
Defense as free agent pick ups, if still possible.  I would like to drop
Engram and the Titans defense. Please let me know.

#sig#Thanks
