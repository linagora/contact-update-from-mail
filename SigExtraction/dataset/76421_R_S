#reply#   Diaspora 'a cancer'
#reply#   ------------------- by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in:
#reply#   Jewish Chronicle, London, 22. Dec. 1989

#reply#   Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,
#reply#   launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth
#reply#   Council meeting in North London, last week.

#reply#   The diaspora, he claimed, "was the cancer connected to the main
#reply#   tissue of the Jewish people". He was scathing about its failure to
#reply#   act before the Holocaust.


   [ deleted for bravity ]


#reply#   Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,
#reply#   unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the
#reply#   country they lived in, he said.

#reply#   He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish
#reply#   people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in
#reply#   literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English
#reply#   language.
