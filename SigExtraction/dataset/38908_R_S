#reply#>This is almost certainly a MacBinary file which is an encoded version

#reply#>You need a program that converts this to a regular file. If this is a

I opened the file with a text editor and it looks like:

^Vnetwork storyboardpictPICT8BIM^E^......

I have already tried BinHex which does not seem to work. 
Any other ideas?
