#reply#> Are you using the traditional radiosity method, progressive refinement, or

#reply#>

My package is based on several articles about non-standard radiosity and
some unpublished methods.

The main articles are:

-  Cohen, Chen, Wallace, Greenberg : 
    A Progressive Refinement Approach to fast Radiosity Image Generation
     Computer Graphics (SIGGRAPH), V. 22(No. 4), pp 75-84, August 1988

-  Silion, Puech
    A General Two-Pass Method Integrating Specular and Diffuse Reflection
    Computer Graphics (SIGGRAPH), V23(No. 3), pp335-344, July 1989

#reply#>

I do not use hemi-cubes. I have no special hardware (SUN SPARCstation).

Use anonymous as username and your e-mail address as password.
