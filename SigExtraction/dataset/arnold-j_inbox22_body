#sig#Dear Mr. Arnold:

Thank you for your email.
Yes, recruiting season is now in full swing.  I am now waiting to hear from
Ms. Chenee Franklin, hoping to secure an interview.  Eva was very helpful
and informative; through her I learned a good deal about Enron's trading
businesses.
Once scheduled for an interview, I would appreciate it if we could talk over
the phone at your convenience.

Again, thank you, and I will keep you updated.

#sig#Sincerely,
