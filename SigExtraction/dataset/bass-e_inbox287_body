Hey, Eric.  How are things in Houston?  I can't believe everything that's going on at Enron right now.  Who ever would have thought Enron would be appealing to Dynegy to buy them?  I'm sure things are pretty crazy right now.  Are you planning to stay on if this goes through?  Not too much new to report here.  Classes are going well, but they're keeping me busy as usual.  It's starting to get really cold here, so I'm going to miss the Houston winter.  I just got an email from Ashley that he and Lani got engaged a couple of days ago.  I doubt you see them too often, but I thought you'd be interested.  Hope things are going well for you.

Brian
