#reply#>>From A.P. :  According to numerous accounts by those in the compound,

#reply#>Oh? Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places?
#reply#>In particular, three different places where there were no APV's?
#reply#>
And just where is the evidence for this? FBI sayso. The Texas Medical
Examiner refuted 2 of their lies today.


#reply#>And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying
#reply#>to get out of the compound?

Let me put you in a building, pump in CS, knock the walls down around
you and see how fast you find an exit.

#reply#>And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.
#reply#>
I don't know why either, you're willing to swallow everything fed you.
Good boy.

#reply#>>I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept

#reply#>I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe
#reply#>a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the
#reply#>contrary. Thought Experiment: Suppose this exact same thing happened under
#reply#>the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still
#reply#>prefer to believe the cultists?

Oh a Clinton apologist, why didn't you *say* so.

#reply#>(No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.)
#reply#>
#reply#>>But then
#reply#>>again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that
#reply#>>his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.
#reply#>
#reply#>Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?
#reply#>
#reply#>>If people will believe that of any politican, it is little wonder they
#reply#>>will believe all of the factoids being given out as fact by the
#reply#>>Clinton/Reno/FBI/BATF confederation.
#reply#>
#reply#>So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty
#reply#>people? Are they, like, just plain evil, or what? Did they just wake up
#reply#>one day, stretch and yawn, and throw a dart at a map of the United States
#reply#>to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know.

The kgBATF was expecting a quick victory while the cameras rolled,
however, they were the only ones with a script.

#reply#>And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he
#reply#>on diabolical laughter? Does he look good in a cape? These things MUST be
#reply#>investigated. You first.

Hey, you're the apologist, *you* tell us.

#reply#>   "...so I propose that we destroy the moon, neatly solving that problem."
