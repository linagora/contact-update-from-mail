Sigh, I was waiting some some not-so-intelligent person to bring this
up.  Look, this is a country of laws. To quote a piece of parchment
that many seem to think is of little importance:

#reply# 4th Amendment
#reply# The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
#reply# papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, 
#reply# shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon 
#reply# probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and 
#reply# particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
#reply# or things to be seized. 

No, a no-knock warrant is in clear violation of the 4th amendment.
Okay, what about the fact that they were tipped off - they shouldn't
have opened fire - right?  WRONG!  Think about this: I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me. They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a no-knock warrant. So,
being moronic sheep we wait, with our guns holstered. Now, instead of
the Feds, in comes my competition, and we're history.  The only
acceptable answer to a no-knock warrant is blazing guns!  I may sound
paranoid, but our government is out of control, and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it.
