I am so happy and relieved to see that Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are in town and have joined in the fight to right all the injustices and inequities brought upon you guys by the dastardly power mongers @ Enron. I will sleep better now that I KNOW your interests are being so protected.-Dad   p.s.-sure hope they also look out for the interests of those of us that "invested" in ENE.
