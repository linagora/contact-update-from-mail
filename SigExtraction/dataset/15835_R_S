#reply#>More than the proposals themselves, I read the language of the press

#reply#>90%, perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the
#reply#>clipper chip, the wiretap bill, the smart card, because they are so
#reply#>entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration.

#reply#>This saddens and frightens me.

#reply#>I am a conserveative believe it or not.  A law and order conserveative.
#reply#>But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me,
#reply#>mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the

#reply#>put cameras in their home.

#reply#>Even in the wake of Waco, you find those who support the increasingly

#reply#>To be quite honest, the way things are going, I'd call it self defense.

#reply#>And I dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera

I never advocated not saying what you believe in.  I'm advocating second
thought, and calm.  

"A smart warrior defeats the enemy in ambush on the battlefield"
"A smarter warrior defeats the enemy in open warfare on the battlefield"
"The smartest warrior defeats the enemy without using the battlefield"

Think about it.
