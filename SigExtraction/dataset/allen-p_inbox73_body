Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.

I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.

In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you. With best regards, Jim Wills
