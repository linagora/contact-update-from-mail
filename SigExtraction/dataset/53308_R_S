#reply#>Hello,
#reply#>
#reply#>I'm writing a story on the future of Gun Control.  There are a
#reply#>few points I would welcome your opinion on.  It's wonderful having a
#reply#>resource like this newsgroup to take advantage of and I thank you in advance
#reply#>for your feedback!
#reply#>
#reply#>1. What do you believe are the most serious threats to gun-owners in the
#reply#>future?  
	* The Government
	* Liberals
	* BATF, FBI, DEA, etc.  (see #1)

#reply#>2. Are you concerned that the 2nd ammendment could be reinterpreted to
#reply#>apply to the armed forces only, barring civilians from owning arms of
#reply#>any kind?
	Well...
		contributions == taxes
		abortion == elimination of fetal tissue
		Clinton == president
		faggot == spouse
	It could happen...

#reply#>3. If you did have control over what types of arms people would be allowed
#reply#>to buy, which types would you feel compelled to restrict to military
#reply#>uses only (ie. bazooka, M16, grenade, atomic bomb, etc.)
	Hydrogen Bomb, perhaps.
	
#reply#>4. Would you describe HCI and all other gun control activists as being
#reply#>determined to make it illegal for a civilian to own or use a firearm?
	Yep.

#reply#>5. Have you personally read the Brady Bill in its entirety?
	Yep.

#reply#>Thank again,
#reply#>
#reply#>Gary
