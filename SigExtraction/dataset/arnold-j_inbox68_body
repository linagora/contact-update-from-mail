Hi John,

The events surrounding the Enron demise are quite disturbing not only to
me but to many of us over here.  Our hearts go out to all the employees
who will not only loose their employment but also most, if not all, of
their savings.  As you know, I've always thought a lot of you; not only
for your trading skills, but also as a person.  You are one of the
largest and most influential traders in the market, yet do not have the
annoying ego so often found in traders of your stature.   I'm absolutely
sure that you'll do well no matter where your career takes you.  I just
wanted you to know that if there is ever anything I can do for you,
please don't hesitate to call.  This is not a solicitation for
employment.  This is from a person who always felt you treated me
honestly and fairly and if the occasion arises, would like to
reciprocate.
