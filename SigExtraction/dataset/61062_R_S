#reply#>	Most of you, as am I, are "children of the 1960's."  We grew
#reply#>up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,
#reply#>nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were
#reply#>miracles of our parent's doing.

#reply#>          Delivered Before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference

#reply#>     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last
#reply#>generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's
#reply#>and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that
#reply#>can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we
#reply#>could do is soft-land on Earth!

Just out of curiousity, how old is Worden?
