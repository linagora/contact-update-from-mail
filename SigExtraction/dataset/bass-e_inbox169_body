World events and resulting airline-industry actions have led us to reconsider the timing of our annual forum. To allow participants to focus on what needs to be done in the recovery from September 11, and to avoid distraction, we have decided to reschedule our Annual Pricing and Revenue Optimization Conference -- originally scheduled during the week of November 4-8, 2001 -- to March 3-7, 2002.

With the four-month delay, we respectfully request that you renew all current conference registrations.  We will continue to communicate news of the conference through e-mail and via our website www.prosRM.com.   We welcome your participation and look forward to seeing you at the event.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need assistance.
