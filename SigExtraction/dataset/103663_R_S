   I sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars, trucks, and busses, but I think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants, or at the wrong time, or both.

   I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars.  They stink!  And it's always
 roll-up-the-windows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when I am driving with my family.

   I don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines, and that's why they stink.  So the 
 invisible, unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels.  Yeah,
 well so what!?  Someone forgot about the visible, stinky kind, and,
 as far as I am concerned, those kind are just as bad.

    I am all for de-stinking the diesel vehicles.  It'll keep the
 traffic signs cleaner, too.
