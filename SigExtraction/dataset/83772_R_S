So you say the credibility of the FBI and ATF is questionalbe.  So be it.
But certainly the credibility of David Koresh was (when he was alive)
absolutely untrustworthy.  The BD's in the compound were by all accounts
absolutely loyal to Koresh, and thus would lie for him.  Thus, the
credibility of his followers must be questionned.  Do you trust them more
than the police?

#reply#>  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs that
#reply#>survived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through their
#reply#>wood-frame house knocked over a lantern which later on caused the
#reply#>compound to errupt in flames.  Also, I have heard that one of the cult
#reply#>members who earlier said that he and another individual started the fire
#reply#>is no longer claiming that he did it.  Moreover, he and possibly the
#reply#>other person may not have even really said that they did it in the
#reply#>first place---we only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS.  I'll believe it when
#reply#>I hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then.

No, I saw one of the escapees say it himself on television.  That was on the
10 o'clock News on channel 5 here in the Bay Area.

#reply#>The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire.  They
#reply#>claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas
#reply#>masks.  Hmmm...  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF
#reply#>agent to me.  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black?  Note:  this
#reply#>is just speculation on my part.  Still, it is something to think about.
#reply#>Here's something else to ponder upon:  the two agents that were planted
#reply#>in the compound might have done something to start that fire.  I don't
#reply#>know if they did it deliberately or not---if they did at all---but I
#reply#>would like to see statements from these two agents on the events that
#reply#>transpired during that day.  I think that they would be rather
#reply#>enlightening don't you think?  They were inside the compound so they
#reply#>ought to have a real good idea of what went on in there.  Of course if
#reply#>they did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would be
#reply#>very forthcoming with any information.

You are speculating that the FBI purposely started the fire?!?!?  Please,
if you've got such a ridiculously extraordinary claim, and have no evidence
whatsoever, at least give us a speculatory reason why the FBI would want to
do such a thing.

The possibility that the fire was started accidentally is much more reasonable,
but we don't have anything but contradictory anecdotal evidence right now.
