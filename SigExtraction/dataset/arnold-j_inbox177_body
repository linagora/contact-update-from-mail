Need your book list from amazon.com!!!!   May sleet and snow tonight but I
think the ground is too warm to  stick or get icy.  Although I could use a
day off work!  Send me your christmas list!  Also, I see that Enron and
Dynegy have been negotiating for days.....this concerns me.  they cannot
seem to come up with a new price.  Are you continuing to lose trading?
what % of normal trades are you now doing a day?  I just hope you and
Matthew are OK.  And Jeannie.  Let me know.  Love you, Mom.
