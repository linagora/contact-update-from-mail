#reply#|> 1) It was recently mentioned on comp.os.linux that there exists a post-

#reply#|>    improvement on Xedit (which I find annoying).

Try to get axe - It's a wonderful X based editor and much simpler to use than
emacs what is a overkill. Of course, emacs is no editor but a religion.

#reply#|> 2) At one point I was the proud owner of an Amiga (and have since upgraded
#reply#|>    to a '386-33).  Workbench (the point-and click interface) used ".info"
#reply#|>    files to store the data for icons associated with applications on a given
#reply#|>    volume.  I have noticed no such architecture anywhere under linux; how
#reply#|>    does Xwindows associate icons with applications?  Can one edit icons or
#reply#|>    generate new ones for applications somehow?  (If it makes a difference
#reply#|>    I'm running 'twm'.)

1) Don't call going from an Amiga to a IBM 'upgrade'
2) The Amiga Workbench did the job of a Desktop manager, and there is no
   really amazing good X Desktop manager in the Public Domain.
   (I'm currently writing one... but it's in very early stage)
3) xdtm may be a medium good replacement.
4) X associates icons with nothing. A number of X Window Managers associate
   icons with windows, in a way to ease window management.
   But this has nothing to do with icons of a Desktop Manager application.
5) The tool bitmap is there for simple icon drawing.

#reply#|> 3) I've noticed some people have somehow discovered a way to display .GIF
#reply#|>    (or some kind of picture files) in the background, either replacing or
#reply#|>    overlapping some the usual grey background employed by Xwindows.  I heard
#reply#|>    this was done using some application, but I don't recall what it was.
