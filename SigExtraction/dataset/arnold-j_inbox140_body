Our initial proposal will be for them to keep all their commission and incremental float, and for Enron to keep our spread.  We have talked about it quite a bit and I expect that they will ask for more than this, but we would hesitate giving them the ability to widen our spreads as this could work against the venture if they got too greedy.  Do you have a preference to work into the negotiation?
