#reply#: You're a great debater.  You chose your sources of information, claim them
#reply#: to  be superior,

I've made no such claim.  Please direct my attention towards any
posting of mine where I claimed superior sources of information.
It's probably because I bothered to post any references at all while
others seem content to post numbers pulled from the ozone, that
you've confused it with fact-twisting.  If so, I apologize.  

#reply#: then take those twisted numbers and twist them further by trying  

Well then, here's fair opportunity for you to prove that I've "twisted
numbers."  On what grounds do you contradict those references?  Do you have
any citations... any sources of your own that I can take similar
gratuitous shots at?

#reply#: to compare absolute numbers between two countries that have major population

You seddit, brudda.
