#reply#> As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give
#reply#> a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the
#reply#> visual was correctly matched

I got several answers, the most complete was from Errol Crary 
(errolc@tv.tv.Tek.com):
#reply#>I have just looked at the R4 server listings (.../mit/server/dix/window.c )
#reply#>and there are several ways in which you can get a BadMatch error, even
#reply#>though my O'Reilly book only says "BorderWidth is nonzero for InputOnly".
#reply#>
#reply#>1- if ((class == InputOnly) && ((bw != 0) || (depth != 0)))
#reply#>
#reply#>
#reply#>2- /* Find out if the depth and visual are acceptable for this Screen */
#reply#>
#reply#>
#reply#>3- if (((vmask & (CWBorderPixmap | CWBorderPixel)) == 0) &&
#reply#>    (class != InputOnly) &&
#reply#>    (depth != pParent->drawable.depth))
#reply#>
#reply#>
#reply#>4- if (((vmask & CWColormap) == 0) &&
#reply#>    (class != InputOnly) &&
#reply#>    ((visual != ancwopt->visual) || (ancwopt->colormap == None)))
#reply#>
#reply#>
#reply#>So, 
#reply#>case 1 is InputOnly which is not your case;  it seems to be the
#reply#>     O'Reilly case.
#reply#>Case 2 should not be the case since you got the visual for the screen.
#reply#>Case 3 looks suspicious; you are giving no CWBorder... in the attribute
#reply#>     mask, and since the visual is not the parent depth, I would suspect you
#reply#>     need to supply a border pixel from the new colormap you are going to use
#reply#>     for this window.
#reply#>Case 4 does not seem to be the problem since you do supply the CWColormap
#reply#>     in the attributes.

                             Thanks for your help
