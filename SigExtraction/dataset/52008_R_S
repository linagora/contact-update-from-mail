#reply#>>As of last week, Mac's Place had the Applied Engineering QuickSilver card

#reply#>>Regular price is $199.

#reply#>>No idea if this is still going on, but I can get the phone no. if anyone is

#reply#>Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
#reply#>with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that
#reply#>a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
#reply#>LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
#reply#>of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
#reply#>you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
#reply#>via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)
#reply#>
#reply#>So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.
#reply#>I would say that is not a good deal.  In June's MacWorld, River
#reply#>(formerly Maya computer) advertised a DayStar 33 MHz PowerCache WITH
#reply#>68882 for $295!  Can you believe it?  I know prices would be falling,
#reply#>but geeze!

Thought you might be interested...
