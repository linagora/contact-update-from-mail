#reply#Markus> Hello everybody out there !

#reply#Markus> I'm trying to compile X11R5pl23 and Motif 1.2.1 on a HP running
#reply#Markus> HP-UX 8.05. But it' seems to be not very succesful, because 
#reply#Markus> I have only hp.cf config-files for HP-UX 7.0. 

#reply#Markus> I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings.
#reply#Markus> The motif applications are compiled quite well, but they won't run.
#reply#Markus> I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ, but
#reply#Markus> I cannot fix it. The XKeysymDB-file is at the right location and it
#reply#Markus> works fine under SunOS.
#reply#Markus> Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong
#reply#Markus> config-file.

#reply#Markus> Please help me !
#reply#Markus>   
#reply#Markus> Thanx in advance 
#reply#Markus>   Markus

If you installed X lib Xt by redefining ProjectRoot, you will find that
 during the install it recompiles one of the files in X lib that does the
search for XKeysmDB and embeds the search path for the file based on whatever
ProjectRoot was defined. TO confirm this what happened, because I'm 
guessing, go to mit/lib/X and do
strings XStrKeySym.o | egrep XKeysymDB
