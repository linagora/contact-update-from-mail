#reply#>-Tim May, whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime

  A remark I heard the other day is beginning to take on increasingly
frightening significance.  The comment was made that "In other parts
of the world the Democrats [note the big "D"] would be known as
Socialists" 

  A [note the small "d"] democrat who wonders what Thomas Jefferson, on
this the 250th anniversary of his birth, would have thought of the state
of affairs between the government and the governed.
