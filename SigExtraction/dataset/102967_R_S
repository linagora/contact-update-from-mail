#reply#|> As long as we're on the subject... Several years ago myself and two others
#reply#|> were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5
#reply#|> north of Seattle, WA. Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
#reply#|> windshield. Not by accident I'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the
#reply#|> overpass quickly to see who did it. We figured it was kids, reported it and
#reply#|> left.
#reply#|> A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. He was
#reply#|> in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. Turned out there was
#reply#|> a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. They caught the 14 year old
#reply#|> that did it. They put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do?
#reply#|> I don't think I'll over forget this story.

In Des Moines, Iowa, about a year ago, some kid dropped a rock from an 
overpass and hit car just behind the windshield.  It put a dent in the roof, 
so I guess I was lucky it hit metal.

It's frustrating that we can't do much.  Bother the city government to put
covers on all overpasses?  Slow down/speed up a bit when driving under all
overpasses in the city?  I like the first better, but that will take time
and lots of people talking to the city governments.

Just another .02...
