#reply#>One of the reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was
#reply#>becase he had a BMW. :)

Sigh.   That's music to my ears, after all the complaining Lois did
about the seat on my BMW...

#reply#>The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements
#reply#>and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,
#reply#>but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.

I've found that the phrase "sack of potatoes" works pretty well in
describing to a passenger how s/he should act.

#reply#>Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be 
#reply#>sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
#reply#>still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.

On a long ride with my ex-girlfriend Nancy, I would notice her
drifting off every so often (we were droning down highway 101 to LA).
I probably wouldn't have been aware of this if she hadn't been in the
habit of squeezing my butt with her knees to hold on.   Good advice.
