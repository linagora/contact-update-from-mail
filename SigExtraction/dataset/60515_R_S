#reply#>80386:  True 32 bit processor.
#reply#>        (cache?)
No cache.

#reply#>80386SX:  Emulates 80386 with a 16 bit bus.

#reply#>80486:  True 32 bit processor.
#reply#>        Internal mathematical coprocessor (Correct?)
Correct.
#reply#>        Internal cache (Correct? How big?)
8kB.
#reply#>        (extended instruction set in any way?)
Was it six instructions?

#reply#>80486SX:  Probably sorta like 80486...
80486DX without the mathematical coprocessor (FPU).
#reply#>80486DX:  Probably sorta like 80386...

Actually, the 80486 you described above is 80486DX.
(There is no separate 80486 nor 80386, either).

This is for Intel processors. Does anyone have a complete
list with Cyrix and Ibm products?
