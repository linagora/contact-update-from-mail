First, the following two quite normal phrases:    

#reply#>  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's question in an intelligent
#reply#>  and unoffending manner?                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^   
       ^^^^^^^^^^^
#reply#>  Now will we please start having some INTELLIGENT conversation?
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^   

and then he shows us what HE means by "intelligent and unoffending manner" 
and "INTELLIGENT conversation":   

#reply#>  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   [...deleted lines...]

#reply#>  The only ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints
#reply#>  with fact are the Israelophiles.
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   [...deleted lines...]      

#reply#>  You all are an insult to you race! {assuming you are also semitic} 
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
   [...deleted lines...]
                                                    

   Later he reveals the truth:

#reply#>  ... I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part Jewish] .....
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
   [...deleted lines...] 

   Shurely he IS an anti-Semite (call it anti-Jew), maybe BECAUSE he
   is "part Jewish"  (e.g. his mother might have *dated*  a Jew who
   didn't marry her, and so she got a little bastard whom she taught
   hatred).  
   
   He is also a coward since he doesn't dare to sign with his name.  
   At the end he signs with a highly intelligent and intellectual 
   phrase:   
 
#reply#>                            Pissed off at Immature,
#reply#>                          Closeminded, Self righteous
#reply#>	                            Semites

#reply#>  You know ed ,...  You're right!  Andi shouldn't be comparing
#reply#>  Israel to the Nazis.  The Israelis are much worse than the
#reply#>  Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for
#reply#>  Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the
#reply#>  damn Jews.  The Holocaust never happened anyway.  Ample
#reply#>  evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard, Dept. of History,
#reply#>  and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU, have shown that the
#reply#>  Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
#reply#>  sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.

   The  Nazis  might also have sent this bastard to the gas chambers
   because of his "part Jewish"ness (only that he is not aware of it).   

PS: I wonder what kind of educational institution is @virginia.edu.
    Could it be the "Free KKK-University of Virginia" ? ;-)
