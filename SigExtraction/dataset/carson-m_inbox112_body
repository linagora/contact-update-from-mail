We finally got signed up with a internet service provider.  I have
attached a business card with our current pertinent information.  If for
some reason the card doesn't work, drop one back and I will just send
the info.  Hope all is well with everyone.  Tina and I have a joint
email as well.  It is cntspain@swbell.net.
