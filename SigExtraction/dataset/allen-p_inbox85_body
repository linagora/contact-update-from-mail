Phillip,

I will get a room for our Wednesday 10:00 meeting and e-mail you with the
room number. FYI, our goal is to discuss the expert path (best answers) for
the storage problem and to ask you some specific questions regarding
storage.

Also, if you have time, could you send me a definition of Intra-Month Risk?

#sig#Thank you for your help.
