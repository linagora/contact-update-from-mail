What a cute baby squirrel!  How old is the little man?  Does he walk yet? I
 'm in Kansas right now...working for my Dad for a couple of weeks(and deer hunting), and am headed up to Manhattan tomorrow night......

I haven't done that in quite awhile!!  I am meeting Ruge and a few other KC Fiji boys, and Blair is coming from Denver.  I haven't been to Manhattan in 3 years or so, and haven't been to a KState f-ball game(in Manhattan) since the 97' season!  It's homecoming, so it should be a pretty fun weekend...of course now that I'm 10 years older than most of the kids there, I may have to be careful I don't get arrested for Child Molesting!!
haha

How's everything else treating you?  I am headed back to Vail around the 5th of Nov., to drive snowcats for the winter....
actually that's my night job....and the job that gets me my insurance and ski pass....I am getting a few photography deals going, so I will be doing that during the daylight hours(oh yeah...and skiing alot!!hehehe).

I actually check my codydownard@hotmail.com account more than this one, so start using that one por favor..

Let me know how everything is going!!

Perge!
Cody
