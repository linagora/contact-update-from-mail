Dear Friends,
It seems so long since we were all together in early December.  Please don't forget that we will meet this Thursday January 3,  2002.
Please read Matthew 2. This is the story of the wise men and  their visit to Jesus. We will celebrate Epiphany next Sunday. Hope all of you  have a Happy and Safe New Year!
