#reply#>hi,

#reply#>  Have you used Mac system 6.x or 7.x? If the answer is positive, you would
#reply#>know if ms-windows is a "mature" OS.

This is silly. Is Unix a mature OS? Depends on who you ask, and how
you define mature. System 7 is, if anything, less mature than Windows 3.1.

#reply#>  Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why
#reply#>they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft
#reply#>simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:

#reply#>(1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group
#reply#>    in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.)

So why do you need something like BeHierarchic to create groups under
the Apple Menu? Everyone knows that Apple Menu Items are a ripoff of
the Program Manager. If you want a hierarchic program launcher there
are lots available.

#reply#>(3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes
#reply#>    an unpredictable error.

And this is easy on a Mac? Give me a break. Having spent hours moving
System Extensions around and restarting the Mac to see why a certain
app crashes all the time, I find this laughable.

#reply#>(4) Group deleting/file deleting
#reply#>    After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.
#reply#>    But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full
#reply#>    of nonsense files.

Oh great. Ever hear of aliases? Wonder why Apple implemented them.

#reply#>(5) share problem
#reply#>    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some
#reply#>    language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just
#reply#>    can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to
#reply#>    prevent from saving, but not opening.

Eh?? I don't follow.

#reply#>  It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to
#reply#>keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more
#reply#>carefully before products distribute.

Why is it that I find the Mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever I
use it? 

#reply#>  No flame, please.

Yeah right. You post flame bait, yet ask for no flames.
