## ContactUpdateFromMail

This project aims at proposing updates on the data of a contact present in an address book of the user. 

For this purpose, it has several parts gathered in this project : a mailet, a daemon and an API. It also contains a first draft of the front end.

Since they are clearly separated, each of these has its own readme to help you use them.
